# CHASE-Gesture-Development-Unity-Myo-
CHASE: Game built in Unity using C# and Thalmic Myo Armband for controls.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you ready to set up the project on you local machine and get it runnng for testing/developing purposes.<br> See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project in development mode you will need:


* [UNITY 5.5.1f1](https://unity3d.com/) - 3D Game Engine used to develop the game
* [VISUAL STUDIO 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/) - The integrated development environment (IDE) used
* [SQLite Manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/) - Firefox Add-On for creation + maintenance of SQLite DB used for the project
* [MYO ARMBAND](https://www.myo.com/) -Gesture recognition device worn on the forearm and manufactured by Thalmic Labs. The Myo enables the user to control technology wirelessly using various hand motions. It uses a set of electromyographic (EMG) sensors that sense electrical activity in the forearm muscles, combined with a gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer to recognize gestures.

Both Visual Studio 2015 and SQLite Manager for Firefox are just personal choices, any other IDE + SQLite Editor may be used.<br>
Only UNITY is a requirement in this case, version specified (5.5.1f1) is advised. <br>
Other versios of Unity will work but may result in *separated* files within the Unity. **i.e. player object couldpossibly be separated from the camera controller.** (Tested)

It is also worth notice that the game itself still can be played without MYO ARMBAND but controls will not seem natural and only the ***TEST SCENE*** will have fairly natural controls. (ARROWS used for movement)
